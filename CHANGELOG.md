### Added
* README.md : Under `Development Setup`, added a step to install current package in "editable" mode, using the pip install -e option.
This removes the need to manually add /src to the PythonPath environment variable in order for debugging and tests to work.

* VS Code settings: Removed the setting which added the /src folder to PythonPath. This is no longer necessary. Installing the project itself as a package in "editable" mode, using the pip install -e option, solves the issue and removes the need to manually add /src to the PythonPath environment variable.
