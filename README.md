# Crane FMU

Introduction
------------
The package includes the necessary modules to construct a crane model according to the fmi, OSP and DNV-RP-0513 standards.
The model shall be used as part of the SEACo project and as a demonstration model for (efficient) usage of the DNV-RP-0513,
Assurance of Simulation Models.

## Installation

```sh
pip install my-package
```

## Usage Example

API:

```py
from my_package import ...
```

CLI:

```sh
my-package ...
```

_For more examples and usage, please refer to my-package's [documentation][my_package_docs]._

## Development Setup

1. Install Python 3.9 or higher, i.e. [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3104/) or [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3114/)

2. Update pip and setuptools:

    ```sh
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    ```

3. git clone the my-package repository into your local development directory:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dnv-innersource/my-package path/to/your/dev/my-package
    ```

4. In the my-package root folder:

    Create a Python virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:

    ..on Windows:

    ```sh
    > .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

    ..on Linux:

    ```sh
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Update pip and setuptools:

    ```sh
    (.venv) $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    ```

    (Optional) If you want PyTorch cuda support on your local machine
    (i.e. to use your GPU for torch operations), you should preferably install PyTorch with cuda support first, before installing all other dependendencies.
    On the official [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
    you can generate a pip install command matching your local machine's operating system, using a wizard.
    If you are on Windows, the resulting pip install command will most likely look something like this:

    ```sh
    (.venv) $ pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    ```

    _Hint:_ If you are unsure which cuda version to indicate in above `pip install .. /cuXXX` command, you can use the shell command `nvidia-smi` on your local system to find out the cuda version supported by the current graphics driver installed on your system. When then generating the `pip install` command with the wizard from the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), select the cuda version that matches the major version of what your graphics driver supports (major version must match, minor version may deviate).

    Install my-package's dependencies. <br>

    ```sh
    (.venv) $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```
    This should return without errors.

    Finally, install my-package itself, yet not as a regular package but as an _editable_ package instead, using the pip install option -e:
    ```sh
    (.venv) $ pip install -e .
    ```

5. Test that the installation works (in the my-package root folder):

    ```sh
    (.venv) $ pytest .
    ```
